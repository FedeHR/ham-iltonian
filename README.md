# 🍖⚛️ ham-iltonian
A Python library for encoding a variety of combinatorial optimization problems into quantum Hamiltonians. The Hamiltonians have the ability to be parametrized, reflecting the effect of different factors, such as time, in challenges like TSP, MaxCut, Knapsack and Portfolio Optimization.

Key features:
- 🔄 Automatic conversion of classical problems to quantum Hamiltonians
- 📊 Support for multiple optimization problems (MaxCut, TSP, Knapsack, Portfolio Optimization)
- 🔌 Integration with PennyLane for quantum simulations
- 📈 Classical solvers included for benchmarking
- 🎨 Built-in visualization tools for solutions
- ⚡ Parametrized Hamiltonian support for dynamic problems (dynamic time, risk factors, or any other desired parameter)

Perfect for researchers and developers working at the intersection of quantum computing and optimization problems.
